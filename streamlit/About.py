    # **About This Web Application ‚ÑπÔ∏è**

    ---

    ### **Overview**
    This Streamlit Web application is part of a **Data Science project** aimed at exploring the impact of climate variability on palm oil yields in Malaysia. By leveraging advanced machine learning models and historical climate data, the application offers actionable insights into the yields of **Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB)** and **Crude Palm Oil (CPO)**.  
    
    üåü The goal of this project is to **help stakeholders assess the effects of climate variability** and plan for future scenarios to ensure sustainable palm oil production.

    The project uses **climate projections** and key climate variables such as precipitation, temperature, humidity, and drought indices to provide accurate yield forecasts and uncover patterns that influence palm oil yields over time.
