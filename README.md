# ðŸŒ´ Palm Oil Yield Prediction Dashboard

This dashboard was developed as part of the WIH3001 Data Science Project course at FSKTM, Universiti Malaya.
It aims to explore and predict palm oil yield trends in Malaysia by analyzing the relationship between climate variables and palm oil production using machine learning and climate projections (SSPs).
The application helps visualize both historical and future trends in Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB) and Crude Palm Oil (CPO) yield, offering insights for sustainability and planning.

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize yearly and monthly trends for FFB and CPO yields.
- **Key Metrics**: Display key performance indicators for the latest year.
- **AI Insights**: Generate AI-powered summaries of the data.
- **Scenario Analysis**: using climate projections (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585).
- **Climate Data Integration**: Analyze the impact of climate variables on yields.

## Data Sources
- **Palm Oil Yield Data**: FFB and CPO monthly yield and production from Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB).
- **Climate Data**: Includes historical and projected climate variables such as precipitation, temperature, and humidity form Climate Change Knowledge Portal (CCKP).

## Tools Used
- **Streamlit**: For building interactive dashboards.
- **Altair**: For creating visualizations.
- **JamAI**: For AI-powered insights.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: for data processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: for machine learning models.
